"""
This Python program uses historical airline flight data from The US Department of Transportation
(https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ) that includes all flights departing
from Oâ€™Hare or Midway in December 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 to suggest the user an airport, weekday and time
of day that they should flight depending on the destination to reduce the potential delay, predicting
which flights from Chicago are more likely to arrive on-time for the upcoming winter break

After asking a user for a destination airport, we would analyze actual flight data for that route for multiple
years and inform the user the best and worst times (e.g., day of the week & morning/afternoon/evening)
to fly that route to minimize the risk of delays.
